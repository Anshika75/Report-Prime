                        <canvas id="myChart4"></canvas>
                        Fluoropolymer coating is used in various application areas such as food processing, electrical &
                        electronics, chemical processing, building & construction, and others. In food processing,
                        fluoropolymer coating is used to ensure easy release of food products, reduce friction, and
                        ensure security against contamination. In electrical & electronics, fluoropolymer coating
                        provides protection against moisture, corrosion, and temperature changes. In chemical
                        processing, it provides resistance against harsh chemicals. In building & construction, it is
                        used to protect structural steel and improve the durability of buildings. The fastest growing
                        application segment in terms of revenue is the electrical & electronics sector as the demand for
                        electronic devices increases and there is a growing need for better protection against moisture
                        and temperature changes. <br><br>

                        Moreover, fluoropolymer coating is used in many other sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and
                        healthcare. In automotive, it is used in engine components to reduce friction and ensure
                        longevity. In aerospace, it is used to protect against extreme temperatures, harsh chemicals,
                        and wear and tear. In healthcare, it is used in medical instruments to ensure easy cleaning,
                        prevent cross-contamination, and increase durability. Overall, fluoropolymer coating provides
                        excellent protective properties and is used widely across various application areas. <br>
